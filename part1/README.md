# Part 1 - Effective Visual Data Communication

(45 minutes instruction + 15 minutes exercise session)

The first part of the tutorial focuses on the why behind great visualizations. We will introduce participants to the principles of designing effective and perceptually efficient visualizations. Participants will learn about chart anatomy, the grammar of graphics, and how to use color, annotations, and layout to guide a viewer’s attention. We’ll also talk about common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

In the first exercise session, participants will have a chance to sketch different visualizations and participate in group discussions on how their design choices influenced the final graphic.
