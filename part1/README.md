# Part 1 - Effective Visual Data Communication

(45 minutes instruction + 15 minutes exercise session)

The first part of the tutorial focuses on the why behind great visualizations. We will introduce participants to the principles of designing effective and perceptually efficient visualizations. Participants will learn about chart anatomy, the grammar of graphics, and how to use color, annotations, and layout to guide a viewer’s attention. We’ll also talk about common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
In the first exercise session, participants will critique a set of case studies – famous charts created with Vega-Altair – and discuss how specific design choices impact their effectiveness. This session sets the foundation for understanding the "why" behind visualization design before diving into the "how."

 - Audience engagement: Start with two charts
   - Soldier mortality over months
   - Soldier mortality in nightingale chart
   - Two stories: casualties over time vs. what might be causing these casualties. 
   - Different representations tell us different stories. 
 - Introduction to different representations: GoG
   - Marks conceptual introduction
   - Encoding Channels conceptual introduction
 - Human Perception
   - Graphical effectiveness
   - Visual affordances, Gestalt relations
