    "  - Grammar of Graphics: marks and encoding channels\n",
    "  - Human perception and graphical effectiveness\n",
    "  - Visual affordances and Gestalt principles\n",
    "  - Using color, annotations, and layout to guide attention\n",
    "  - Common visualization pitfalls and how to avoid them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Data Types, Graphical Marks, and Visual Encoding Channels\n",
    "- **Objective**: Learn the basic syntax of Altair, understand how to encode data into visual properties, and customize chart appearances.\n",
    "- **Key Topics**:\n",
    "  - Basic Altair syntax\n",
    "  - Encoding data dimensions\n",
    "  - Customizing chart appearance\n",
